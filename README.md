# We covered:

* Recap with slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ATFAdaQt9PxJawrUGoPScET5o4wCWMh63HxW57h44Go/edit#slide=id.g21037fae850_0_188
* added **head** and **body** tags
* CSS - Styled my page a bit, show them (colors, buttons, borders, alignment, etc) 


## Suggestions for next week:
  * Walk through an example of a mistake: remove closing H1 tag. Explain that browser reads next line as h1 still, then the next line, then gets to h2 as is like "wtf". 
     * Or....better yet. Remove closing h1 and ask the class why my fonts are big. get them to find the bug. 
     
  * Revisit page2 link
  * Move styles to styles.css <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  * review CSS syntax
